## Description
A memory game built as project number two for the Grow with Google Udacity Front End Web developer challenge

## Project Requirements
*The project challenge was to build a game that accomplishes the following:*
- The game shuffles the deck
- The user can click the cards to flip them over
- If the cards don't match, they are turned back over and do not display
- The player wins by matching all cards
- When the user wins, a modal displays with their stats inside, which include their rating,   how long it took, and how many moves they made
- The modal asks if the player wants to try again, they can click to restart
- A restart button on the board allows the player to restart the game at any time
- The player is rated with stars ranging from 1-3 depending on how many moves are made
- When the player wins, the game timer stops

## How I Built the Game:
- I built the game with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
*the game is responsive for various viewports*

- Created a deck of cards
- Displayed the cards on the page
- Created a function to flip them over and check to see if they were matching
- Created a star rating, moves made display, and time took display
- Created a modal and added the stats in the modal to show when the game is won
- Styled the game with a spooky look since I am a horror fan
- Used fun icons for Slack, Stack Exchange, and a few other of my favorite sites and
  applications

## Instructions for Gameplay:
1. Click on any card to turn it over
2. Click a second card and see if it's a match
3. If the cards don't match, they will return to a face-down position
4. Continue clicking cards until you match all the cards

*To restart the game at any time, click the "restart" icon and the board will reset*

- You will be graded with a star rating from 1-3 stars as you play
- Your time playing, rating, and move count will be displayed throughout the game
- If you win, a congratulations pop-up will display with your stats

*If you wish to play again after winning, click the "baby hit me one more time" button (who doesn't love Brittany?!)*

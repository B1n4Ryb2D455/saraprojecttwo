# Memory Game Project

A memory game built as project number two for the Grow with Google Udacity Front End Web developer challenge.

Built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML - the game is responsive to work with different devices and it's FUN!

Instructions:
Click on any card to turn it over
Click a second card and see if it's a match
If the cards don't match, they will return to a face-down position
Continue clicking cards until you match all the cards
To restart the game at any time, click the "restart" icon and the board will reset
You will be graded with a star rating from 1-3 stars as you play
Your time playing will be displayed throughout the game
If you win, a congratulations pop-up will display with your stats
If you wish to play again after winning, click the "baby hit me one more time" button (who doesn't love Brittany?!)
